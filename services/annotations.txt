- By default services can only run between ports 30000 and 32767, 
    but could be changed by adding '--service-node-port-range=<new_range>' argument 
    to the kube-apiserver on the init scripts of cluster's master node.

- svc is a short describe for services, so you can use on commands like this: kubectl get svc
