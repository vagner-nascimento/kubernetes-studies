Kubernetes Architeture:
- Each nod has a 'kubelet' and a 'kube-proxy' service running.
    * kubelet - responsable to lauch the pods, communicate with master node to get this information
    * kube-proxy - feeds the information about pods on this node to iptables

IMPORTANT about Service Descriptions:
    - "NodePort" could be used for access from others containers on the same pod.
    - "Endpoints" could be used to connect by another pods on the cluster.
